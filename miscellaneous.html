<h1 style="font-family:verdana;"><u>Miscellaneous CPD hours</u></h1>

<b style="font-family:verdana;">Here are all my miscellaneous events that count towards my CPD hours.</b>

<h5 style="font-family:verdana;">The total amount of miscellaneous hours counted towards my continued personal development is 3 hours and 30 minutes.</h5>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><u>Freshers society fair</u></h2>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">This fair was held during the first week of freshers on the <u>25/9/18</u>, I was there for 2 hours. This fair was held for all freshers to attend so that they could get loads of freebies from businesses such as Wilko's and Dominoes but also to sign up to any societies that interest them. Unfortunately I did not find any societies that interested me but it informed me how to join a society and how it works. Dominoes was giving out free pizza and Wilko's gave out free home essential goody bags. The freshers fair gave me a small insight to what uni life was going to be like as it was held on the second day I moved in.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana;"><u>Quiz night</u></h2>

<p style="font-family:verdana;"> Me and all my flatmates went out together to the point which is the NTSU building for entertainment and events. We visited the point because it was the fortnightly quiz night which was hosted on the <u>23/9/18</u>. The main theme for the quiz was Marvel, so all the questions asked that night were related to Marvel which was unfortunate because we didn't know much about marvel and wed all paid the £1 entry fee. We were there for roughly one hour and half before we left because the questions got too difficult for us.</p>
